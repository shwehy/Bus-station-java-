# Station-Bus
This project is almost a complete simulation for a real-life bus station. First, we have the bus
station itself with a complete set of vehicles like a bus, minibus, limousine, ...etc. Second, there
are the employees who are divided into drivers and managers. Third, the passengers
(customers) who are trying to buy a ticket for a specific trip.A customer can reserve one-way
trip or round trip. Fourth, we have two main types of trips; internal (between cities) and
external (between countries), they differ in price, distance, ...etc. Also, a trip can be nonstop,
one-stop or many stops
